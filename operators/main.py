# What is operators?
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, //
# Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=
# Comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# Logical operators: and, or, not
# Identity operators: is, is not
# Membership operators: in, not in
# Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

# Arithmetic operators
# +   Addition
# -   Subtraction
# *   Multiplication
# /   Division
# %   Modulus
# **  Exponentiation
# //  Floor division

# print(10%3)
# print(4**2)
# print(19//5)

# Assignment operators

# a =5
# a+=60
# print(a)

# Comparison operators
#  == Equal
#  != Not equal
#  >  Greater than
#  <  Less than
#  >= Greater than or equal to
#  <= Less than or equal to

# a=5
# b=5
# print(a==b)
# print(a!=b)
# print(a>b)
# print(a<b)
# print(a>=b)
# print(a<=b)


# Logical operators
# and:  Returns True if both statements are true
# or:   Returns True if one of the statements is true
# not:  Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true

# print(5>3 and 5>2)
# print(5<3 or 5>2)
# print(not(5>3 and 5>2))

# Identity operators
# is:    Returns True if both variables are the same object
# is not:Returns True if both variables are not the same object

# a =5
# b=6
# c=a
# print(id(a))
# print(id(b))
# print(id(c))
# print(a is b)
# print(a is c)
# print(a is not b)

# Membership operators
# in:    Returns True if a sequence with the specified value 
#        is present in the object
# not in:Returns True if a sequence with the
#      specified value is not present in the object


# name ='sophia'
# print('s' in name)
# print('s' not in name)
# print('z' in name)
# print('z' not in name)


# a =5
# b=6
# print(bin(a))
# print(bin(b))
#  101
#  110
#  100
# print(a&b)

# print(bin(4))

# x='a'
# print(ord(x))


# a = 2+5 / (3*2) ** 2
# print(a)
