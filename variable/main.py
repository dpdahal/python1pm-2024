# What is variable?
# Variable is a container for storing data values.

# name ='John'
# print(name)


# Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

# Legal variable names:
# myvar = "John"
# my_var = "John"
# h1 = "John"
# _ = "John"

# Illegal variable names:
# 2myvar = "John"
# my-var = "John"
# my var = "John"
# 1h = "John"
# myusername='ram'
# Variable case 
# my_user_name: snake_case -> function
# myUserName: camelCase -> variable
# MyUserName: PascalCase -> class or Object


# name =34
# age =20
# print("My name is ",name,"age",age)
# print("My name is {} and age is {}".format(name,age))
# print(f"My name is {name} and age is {age}")
# print("My name is %s and age is %d"%(name,age))


# print(name)
# print(age)

# x=10


# x=10


# age = 10

# print(age)

# x=1
# y=6
# print(x)
# print(y)

# x,y = 1,6
# print(x)
# print(y)

# *x,y=4,6,7,8,9,78,98,89
# print(x,y)
# print(y)
